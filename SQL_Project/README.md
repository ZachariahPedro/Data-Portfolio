# Northwind Database — SQL

This project investigates late shipment complaints using the Northwind sample database. The analysis focuses on identifying shipment delays, quantifying their impact on revenue and freight costs, and uncovering patterns related to customers, shippers, and seasonality.



### What this demonstrates:

- Data preparation & cleaning in SQL – combining multiple tables, handling missing dates, and creating calculated fields.

- Analytical SQL queries – grouping, filtering, and using CASE statements for business logic.

- Business impact awareness – translating delays into metrics like revenue at risk and freight costs.

- Reproducibility & documentation – use of views and clear query structure so other analysts can reuse and extend the work.

- Communication skills – ability to turn SQL outputs into insights that matter to operations and sales stakeholders.
